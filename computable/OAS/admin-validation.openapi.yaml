        Deletes the EHR identified by `ehr_id`. 

        All corresponding or owned resources, such as COMPOSITION, EHR_STATUS, ITEM_TAG, etc. including historical versions, will also be (physically) deleted.

        The server may perform this operation in an asynchronous way (in batches), in which case status `202 Accepted` is returned,
        or may perform this operation directly, in which case (by successful outcome) will return status `204 No Content`.

        All corresponding or owned resources by the candidate EHRs, such as COMPOSITION, EHR_STATUS, ITEM_TAG, etc. 
        including historical versions, will also be (physically) deleted.

        The server may perform this operation in an asynchronous way (in batches), in which case status `202 Accepted` is returned,

      description: |
        `204 No Content` is returned when the requested operation succeeded and the resource(s) identified by the request parameters has been physically deleted (i.e. hard-delete).
