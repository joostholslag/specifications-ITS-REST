= REST development tool

This tool will parse OAS source files located on /specifications folders and will generate:
* for validation /computable/OAS/*-validation.openapi.yaml,
* for code generators /computable/OAS/*-codegen.openapi.yaml,

== Usage

First you will need to change directory to `development`.
Docker-compose will be used to create a container with PHP code that will perform all necessary tasks.
The sequence of commands should normally be:
```bash
cd development
docker-compose run --rm php composer install
./bundle.sh all       # to build all OAS files
./bundle.sh overview  # to build only the overview OAS files
```

An alternative is to use the provided wrapper bash script. To get the help on this command you will need to execute:
```
./run
```

You can also use:
* `./generate.sh` to generate code according to predefined configurations
* `./validate.sh` to validate OAS build files
* `./watch.sh` to watch a rendered OAS file while developing it

== Output

Files are generated in `computable/OAS/` directory.
