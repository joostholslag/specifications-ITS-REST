operationId: admin_ehr_delete_all
summary: Delete multiple EHRs
description: |

  Deletes all or multiple EHRs, or a specified subset of EHRs identified using the `ehr_id` query parameter. 

  > NOTE: This functionality is intended primarily for **development** or **testing** purposes and may be disabled in **production** environments, in which case server may respond with `405 Method Not Allowed`.
  
  All resources associated with or owned by the targeted EHRs (such as COMPOSITION, EHR_STATUS, ITEM_TAG, CONTRIBUTION, and their historical versions) will also be **permanently** and physically deleted, in compliance with applicable data protection regulations (e.g., the GDPR in the European Union).
  
  The server may execute this operation asynchronously (e.g. in batches), in which case returns status `202 Accepted`.
  If the deletion is processed synchronously and completes successfully, the server returns status `204 No Content`.
