operationId: admin_ehr_delete_all
summary: Delete multiple EHRs
description: |

  Deletes all EHRs, or a subset of EHRs defined using the `ehr_id` query parameter. 

  The delete all EHRs functionality is for **DEVELOPMENT** use only and should be **disabled in production**.
  
  All corresponding or owned resources by the candidate EHRs, such as COMPOSITION, EHR_STATUS, ITEM_TAG, etc. 
  including historical versions, will also be (physically) permanently deleted in compliance with GDPR.
  
  The server may perform this operation in an asynchronous way (in batches), in which case status `202 Accepted` is returned,
  or may perform this operation directly, in which case (by successful outcome) will return status `204 No Content`.
