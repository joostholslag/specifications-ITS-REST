operationId: admin_ehr_delete
summary: Delete EHR by id
description: |
  Deletes the EHR identified by `ehr_id`. 
  
  All resources associated with or owned by the specified EHR (such as COMPOSITION, EHR_STATUS, ITEM_TAG, CONTRIBUTION, and their historical versions) will also be **permanently** and physically deleted, in compliance with applicable data protection regulations (e.g., the GDPR in the European Union).

  The server may execute this operation asynchronously (e.g. in batches), in which case returns status `202 Accepted`.
  If the deletion is processed synchronously and completes successfully, the server returns status `204 No Content`.
